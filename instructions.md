Exercise 1
Let's start with a small simple program - in Python - that fetches the data results from the following API
endpoint: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=20
Exercise 2
Ok. Next! Can you create a function that accepts and formats the response of the API in such a way that
the result is an array of strings, where each string is a concatenation of the first name and last name.
Please filter out the people for us who are born after the year 2000. Finally, can you also log the output
to the console so that it looks like the example below.
[
'James Bond',
'Ash Ketchum'
]
Exercise 3
Awesome, well on your way! Of course, we want to make sure this functionality keeps working in the
future. Can you write at least one test - using any framework of your choice - to test your functionality.
Exercise 4
Here we would like you to call an LLM (Free LLM Providers) and find out who the person is (note- due to
free pricing, keep an eye on rate limit – for this exercise you can stick to 5 random people)?
Exercise 5
Great, your program is running. Can you now create an agentic workflow using Langchain to give more
details on the best work that person has done (keep an eye on limits again)?
Bonus Exercise
• You may notice not all people have something that stands out, how can you present it better in
the results?
• How can you improve performance of the application?
• Can you create an architecture flow of the exercises?
• Are there any best practices you would consider?
Sharing code/presentation/feedback - Please share a brief presentation of how you would like to
explain the assignment, source code - .py / .ipynb files, this can be done by compressing all in a zip file
and sharing it in an email. In addition, please let us know how you experience the assignment. Was it
easy, medium, or hard assessment? Also, 90 minutes was enough.
